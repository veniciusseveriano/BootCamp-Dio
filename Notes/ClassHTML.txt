Lesson 1 - Basic structure of HTML 5:

   • The element is the basis of HTML, so it has the opening tag, the attribute, the content and the closing tag. Ex: <h1 class="title"</h1>
   
   • Its basic structure is: <!DOCTYPE html>
                             <html lang="pt-br">
                              <head>
                                <title>Page Title</title>
                                <meta charset="utf-8">
                              </head>
                              <body>
                                Here is the HTML code that will make your site appear.
                              </body>
                             </html>

   • My first practice with HTML, I do in app VSCODE, and I do an site that shows only my name on head of site, and on his body I put the phrase "Venícius Severiano is a owner of Leon and love the Twilight Saga"
   
   • The code stayed thus:  <!DOCTYPE html>
                             <html lang="pt-br">
                              <head>
                                <meta charset="utf-8">
                                <title>Venícius Severiano</title>
                              </head>
                              <body>
                                Venícius Severiano is a owner of Leon and love the Twilight Saga
                              </body>
                             </html>

Lesson 2 - Semantic part 1: 

   • <section>. Represent an section generic of content, how a list of articles... 
   • <header>. Represent the header of the page, or part of section
   • <article>. Represent an relevant content of your page, how a blog article...
   • <aside> Represent a content related with the main content of page, how an bio of author, related links...
   • <footer> Represent an footnote of page, article, section...
   • <h1>-<h6> Represent an semantic of page, how an title within a page. Exemple: <h1 title of page>, <h2 title of section>, <h3 title of article>... But it can only have one H1 per page

Lesson 3 - Semantic part 2: 

   • In this lesson I learned how to use the tags of the past lesson, and I put it on Vscode. 

   • The code stayed thus: <!DOCTYPE html>
                           <html>
                            <head>
                              <meta charset="utf-8">
                              <title>Venícius Severiano</title>
                            </head>
                            <body>
                            <header>
                              <h1>Venícius Severiano</h1>
                            </header>
                            <section> 
                              <header>
                                 <h2>Posts</h2>
                              </header>
                              <article> 
                                <header>
                                  <h3>Post #1</h3>
                                </header>
                              </article>
                            </section>
                            <footer> </footer>
                           </body>
                          </html>

• Lesson 4 - Tags for texts:

   • For contents of texts larger, I use the element <p> Content </p> 
   • It represent an paragrapher, but it don't support just text, but support other contents how images, videos...

• Lesson 5 - Tags for links: 

   • Other tag important for an site is the tag <a> link </a> 
   • Represent an "anchor", so interconnecting various content on the web. 
   • <a href= Content </a>, represent an hyperlink that your "anchor" is pointing to, how an page of site or an external site
   • And it can be pointing to email or number phone, but you have to put an prefixe "mailto" for email, and "tel" for an number phone 
   • <a target="_blank> LINK </a>, represent how this link go to open
   • _blank represent that go open the link in an new tab

• Lesson 6 - Practice exercise: 

   • Now I go include the new tags that I learned on my code.

   • The code stayed thus: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Venícius Severiano</title>
    </head>
    <body>
     <header>
        <h1>Venícius Severiano</h1>
     </header>
     <section> 
        <header>
            <h2>Posts</h2>
        </header>
        <article> 
            <header>
                <h3>Post #1</h3>
            </header>
            <p> 
                Lorem Ipsum is simply <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/veniciusseveriano/" target="_blank">dummy text of</a> the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a <a href="mailto: veniciusseveriano@gmail.com" target="_blank">of</a> type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                 and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            </p>
        </article>
     </section>
     <footer> </footer>
    </body>
</html>

• Lesson 7 - Tag img: 

   • <img> its a tag to include image to our 
   • <img src="img/avatar.jpg">,the atribute SCR ITS MANDATORY, because it stores the image path. 
   • <img alt="Picture of Venicius">, it shows the description of photo when it doesn't load 

• Lesson 8 - Practice exercise: 

   • Now I go include the new tags that I learned on my code.

   • The code stayed thus:

• Lesson 9 - Tags Il, Ul and Ol:

   • The tags <ul>, <ol> and <li>, refer to lists. 

   • <ul> represent a list that order of itens is no important

   • <ol> represent a list that a order of itens is important. And is represent like numbers Roman numeral...

   • <li> represent a item of this list 

• Lesson 10 - Practice exercise: 

   • In this lesson I will go add a list of contacts on footer of site. 

   • The code stayed thus:

So, the class of HTML is over for here. See you soon. Bye!!
