Lesson 1 - Basic structure of HTML 5:

   • The element is the basis of HTML, so it has the opening tag, the attribute, the content and the closing tag. Ex: <h1 class="title"</h1>
   
   • Its basic structure is: <!DOCTYPE html>
                             <html lang="pt-br">
                              <head>
                                <title>Page Title</title>
                                <meta charset="utf-8">
                              </head>
                              <body>
                                Here is the HTML code that will make your site appear.
                              </body>
                             </html>

   • My first practice with HTML, I do in app VSCODE, and I do an site that shows only my name on head of site, and on his body I put the phrase "Venícius Severiano is a owner of Leon and love the Twilight Saga"
   
   • The code stayed thus:  <!DOCTYPE html>
                             <html lang="pt-br">
                              <head>
                                <meta charset="utf-8">
                                <title>Venícius Severiano</title>
                              </head>
                              <body>
                                Venícius Severiano is a owner of Leon and love the Twilight Saga
                              </body>
                             </html>
