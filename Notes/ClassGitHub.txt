To add any repository changes from Git to GitHub, one must:

1°) use the command: git add <file>

2°) use the command: git commit -m "comment"

3°) use the command: git push origin main

With that, as soon as you press F5 on your GitHub, your remote repository will be up to date with the local one.

PS: If you just want to update some file, be it text, or even a folder, repeat the process from the beginning.
